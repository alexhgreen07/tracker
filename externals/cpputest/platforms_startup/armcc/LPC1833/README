Project for LPC1833 is based on LPCOpen. Unused functions is removed to make
a small code instead of a fat one.

Semihosting is in use. For time measurement, SystemTimer in Cortex-M3 core is
used. Any pin is not initialized. 

Debug output is done using SWO (ITM channel 0).

Working frequency is getting from Internal RC (12 MHz), so no PLL setup is used,
no quartz is required.
